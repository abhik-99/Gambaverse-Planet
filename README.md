# Gambaverse Demo (This is not the main site)

This is the UI built for Gambaverse. A live demo of the app is avaiable on Heroku at this [link](https://gamba-planet.herokuapp.com/).

*Please note that this is not the main app. To see the code for the main/current app please refer to the original repo instead of this fork.*

## Stack:
The general stack used by me to build this is as follows:-
1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [MUI v5](https://mui.com/)
3. [EthersJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers)
