# Gambaverse Demo (This is not the main site)

This is the UI built for Gambaverse. The app works on Ethereum Mainnet.
- If the user does not have Metamask Chrome Extension installed, the app prompts the user for it.
- If the user is not on Eth Mainnet, the app prompts for the switch and refreshes.

This repo contains my UI Design modifications and the demo for that is shown as a video in the sections below.
**Please note that this is not the main app. To see the code for the main/current app please refer to the original repo instead of this fork.**

## How to run this app

1. Clone the GitHub repo.
2. Go to the cloned repo directory and run `npm install`.
3. From that directory run `npm start` or `npm run start`.
